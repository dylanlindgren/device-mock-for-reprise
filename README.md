# Device Mock for Reprise

![Device Mock for Reprise logo](images/dmr-logo.svg)

Device Mock for Reprise is a ServiceNow application that offers a simple way to capture mobile and in-device experiences as part of a [Reprise](https://www.getreprise.com) replay.

Reprise operates as a browser plugin, which captures experiences as they happen in a browser and saves them to be used as a part of a Reprise replay. The full HTML and CSS of an experience is captured by the browser plugin and saved so that it can be replayed.

One issue though is that not every demo happens in a web browser â€“ some happen on a mobile device like an iPhone, iPad or Android device. This application allows you to easily take an in-device experience like this and replicate it inside your web browser, thus allowing you capture it using the Reprise browser plugin.
